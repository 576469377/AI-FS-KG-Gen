Listeria monocytogenes is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and elderly.
        Soft cheeses, deli meats, and unpasteurized milk products may contain Listeria.
        Refrigeration temperatures below 40°F (4°C) slow bacterial growth but don't eliminate it.
        HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) systems help ensure food safety.
