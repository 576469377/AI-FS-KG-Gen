Listeria monocytogenes poses significant risk to pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals.
            Ready-to-eat deli meats and soft cheeses frequently harbor Listeria bacteria.
            The pathogen can multiply at refrigeration temperatures unlike other foodborne bacteria.
            Heat treatment to 74Â°C for 15 seconds destroys Listeria in processed foods.
            Environmental monitoring programs detect Listeria in food processing facilities.
