Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria can cause severe foodborne illness. 
        Ground beef contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 has been linked to several outbreaks.
        Proper cooking to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C) can kill harmful bacteria.
        Raw vegetables should be washed thoroughly to prevent contamination.
