Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination in ground beef represents a serious public health threat.
            The pathogen can survive at refrigeration temperatures of 4°C for extended periods.
            Proper cooking to internal temperature of 71°C (160°F) effectively destroys E. coli bacteria.
            Cross-contamination occurs when raw meat juices contact ready-to-eat foods.
            Hand washing with soap for 20 seconds prevents pathogen transmission.
            The FDA requires HACCP implementation in meat processing facilities.
