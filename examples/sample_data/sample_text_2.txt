Salmonella is a common cause of food poisoning. Poultry products, eggs, and dairy
        can harbor Salmonella bacteria. The FDA recommends cooking chicken to 165°F (74°C).
        Cross-contamination occurs when raw meat juices contact ready-to-eat foods.
        Proper hand washing and sanitization prevent the spread of pathogens.
