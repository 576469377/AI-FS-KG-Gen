Salmonella enteritidis outbreak linked to contaminated eggs affected 200 people.
            Poultry products must be cooked to minimum internal temperature of 74°C (165°F).
            The CDC recommends pasteurization of egg products to eliminate Salmonella bacteria.
            Refrigeration below 4°C slows bacterial growth but does not eliminate pathogens.
            Sanitization with chlorine solution at 200 ppm concentration kills Salmonella.
