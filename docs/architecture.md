# AI-FS-KG-Gen Architecture

## Overview

AI-FS-KG-Gen is a comprehensive pipeline for building large-scale multi-source heterogeneous food safety knowledge graphs using advanced AI technologies including Large Language Models (LLM), Vision Language Models (VLM), and Knowledge Graph (KG) techniques.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

The data ingestion layer handles multi-source data input:

- **Text Loader**: Processes text files (TXT, PDF, HTML, Markdown)
- **Image Loader**: Handles image files (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.)
- **Structured Data Loader**: Manages structured data (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- **URL Ingestion**: Fetches content from web sources

### 2. Data Processing Layer

The processing layer leverages AI models for content understanding:

- **Text Cleaner**: Normalizes and preprocesses text data
- **LLM Processor**: Uses large language models for:
  - Text summarization
  - Entity extraction
  - Relation extraction
  - Text classification
  - Knowledge generation
- **VLM Processor**: Employs vision-language models for:
  - Image captioning
  - Visual question answering
  - Food safety analysis
  - Visual content classification

### 3. Knowledge Extraction Layer

Specialized extractors identify food safety knowledge:

- **Entity Extractor**: Identifies food safety entities:
  - Food products and ingredients
  - Pathogens and microorganisms
  - Chemical compounds and allergens
  - Safety standards and regulations
  - Processing methods and conditions
- **Relation Extractor**: Discovers relationships:
  - Contains/composition relations
  - Causal relationships (causes/prevents)
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Processing relationships
  - Storage and handling requirements

### 4. Knowledge Graph Layer

Constructs and manages the knowledge graph:

- **Knowledge Graph Builder**: Supports multiple backends:
  - NetworkX (in-memory graphs)
  - Neo4j (graph database)
  - RDF (semantic web)
- **Graph Operations**: Entity resolution, relation validation, graph merging

### 5. Pipeline Orchestration

Coordinates the entire workflow:

- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Manages execution flow
- **Configuration Management**: Handles settings and parameters
- **Result Management**: Stores and exports results
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multi-threading for efficiency

## Component Details

### Data Flow

```
Input Sources → Data Ingestion → Data Processing → Knowledge Extraction → Knowledge Graph Construction → Output
```

1. **Input Sources**: Files, directories, URLs containing food safety information
2. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is loaded and metadata is extracted
3. **Data Processing**: AI models process content for understanding
4. **Knowledge Extraction**: Entities and relations are identified
5. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Structured knowledge graph is built
6. **Output**: Results are exported in various formats

### AI Model Integration
